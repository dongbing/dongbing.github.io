They are not immersed in the water, so the weight of a leaf is not balanced by a buoyant force. Instead, the force balancing a leaf’s weight arises because of the surface tension of the water. Surface tension is a property that allows the surface of a liquid to behave somewhat as a trampoline does. When a person stands on a trampoline, the trampoline stretches downward a bit and, in so doing, exerts an upward elastic force on the person. This upward force balances the person’s weight. The surface of the water behaves in a similar way. In Figure 1, for instance, you can see the indentations in the water surface made by the feet of an insect known as a water strider, because it can stride or walk on the surface just as a person can walk on a trampoline.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> The indentations in the water surface made by a water strider are readily seen in this photograph. The surface tension of the water allows the insect to walk on the water without sinking. (&copy; Hermann Eisenbess/Photo Researchers)</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates the molecular basis for surface tension by considering the attractive forces that molecules in a liquid exert on one another. Part a shows a molecule within the bulk liquid, so that it is surrounded on all sides by other molecules. Thesurrounding molecules attract the central molecule equally in all directions, leading to a zero net force. In contrast, part b shows a molecule in the surface. Since there are no molecules of the liquid above the surface, this molecule experiences a net attractive force pointing toward the liquid interior. This net attractive force causes the liquid surface to contract toward the interior until repulsive collisional forces from the other molecules halt the contraction at the point when the surface area is a minimum. If the liquid is not acted upon by external forces, a liquid sample forms a sphere, which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. Nearly spherical drops of water are a familiar sight, for example, when the external forces are negligible.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> (a) A molecule within the bulk liquid is surrounded on all sides by other molecules, which attract it equally in all directions, leading to a zero net force. (b) Amolecule in the surface experiences a net attractive force pointing toward the liquid interior, because there are no molecules of the liquid above the surface.</p>
<p>To help us define the surface tension we use the apparatus shown in Figure 3. It consists of a C-shaped wire frame, on which is mounted a wire that can slide with negligible friction. The frame and sliding wire contain a thin film of liquid. Because surface tension causes the liquid surface to contract, a force $F$ is needed to move the slider to the right and extend the surface. The surface tension is denoted by the Greek letter gamma ($\gamma$) and, as indicated by Equation 1, is the magnitude $F$ of the force per unit length over which it acts. Table 1 gives the value of the surface tension for some typical materials.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>DEFINITION OF SURFACE TENSION<br>The surface tension γ is the magnitude F of the force exerted parallel to the surface of a liquid divided by the length L of the line over which the force acts:</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>$$<br>\gamma = \frac{F}{L}<br>\tag{1}<br>$$<br>SI Unit of Surface Tension: $N/m$</p>
<p>For the specific case illustrated in Figure 3, there is an upper surface and a lower surface, as the blow-up drawing indicates. Thus, the force $F$ acts along a total length of $L = 2l$, where $l$ is the length of the slider.</p>

<h2 id="Capillary-Action"><a href="#Capillary-Action" class="headerlink" title="Capillary Action"></a>Capillary Action</h2><p>We have seen that surface tension arises because of the intermolecular forces of attraction that molecules in a liquid exert on one another. These forces, which are between like molecules, are called <strong><em>cohesive forces</em></strong>. A liquid, however, is often in contact with a solid surface, such as glass. Then additional forces of attraction come into play. They occur between molecules of the liquid and molecules of the solid surface and, being between unlike molecules, are called <strong><em>adhesive forces</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Consider a tube with a very small diameter, which is called a capillary. When a capillary, open at both ends, is inserted into a liquid, the result of the competition between cohesive and adhesive forces can be observed. For instance, Figure 4 shows a glass capillary inserted into water. In this case, the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, so that the water molecules are attracted to the glass more strongly than to each other. The result is that the water surface curves upward against the glass. It is said that the water “wets” the glass. The surface tension leads to a force $F$ acting on the circular boundary between the water and the glass. This force is oriented at an angle $\phi$, which is determined by the competition between the cohesive and adhesive forces. The vertical component of F pulls the water up into the tube to a height $h$. At this height the<br>vertical component of $F$ balances the weight of the column of water of length $h$.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4</strong> Water rises in a glass capillary due to the surface tension of the water and the fact that the water wets the glass surface.</p>
<p>Figure 5 shows a glass capillary inserted into mercury, a situation in which the adhesive forces are weaker than the cohesive forces. The mercury atoms are attracted to each other more strongly than they are to the glass. As a result, the mercury surface curves downward against the glass and the mercury does not “wet” the glass. Now, in contrast to the situation illustrated in Figure 4, the surface tension leads to a force $F$, the vertical component of which pulls the mercury down a distance $h$ in the tube. The behavior of the liquids in both Figures 4 and 5 is called capillary action.</p>

<h2 id="Pressure-Inside-a-Soap-Bubble-and-a-Liquid-Drop"><a href="#Pressure-Inside-a-Soap-Bubble-and-a-Liquid-Drop" class="headerlink" title="Pressure Inside a Soap Bubble and a Liquid Drop"></a>Pressure Inside a Soap Bubble and a Liquid Drop</h2><p>Anyone who’s blown up a balloon has probably noticed that the air pressure inside the balloon is greater than on the outside. For instance, if the balloon is suddenly released, the greater inner pressure forces the air out, propelling the balloon much like a rocket. The reason for the greater pressure is that the tension in the stretched rubber tends to contract the balloon. To counteract this tendency, the balloon has a greater interior air pressure acting to expand the balloon.</p>
<p>A soap bubble (see Figure 7a) has two spherical surfaces (inside and outside) with a thin layer of liquid in-between. Like a balloon, the pressure inside a soap bubble is greater than that on the outside. As we will see shortly, this difference in pressure depends on the surface tension $\gamma$ of the liquid and the radius $R$ of the bubble. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that there is no pressure on the outside of the bubble ($P_o = 0$). Now, imagine that the stationary soap bubble is cut into two halves. Being at rest, each half has no acceleration and so is in equilibrium. According to Newton’s second law of motion, a zero acceleration implies that the net force acting on each half must be zero ($\sum F = 0$). We will now use this equilibrium relation to obtain an expression relating the interior pressure to the surface tension and the radius of the bubble.</p>
<p><img src="_v_images/20181220005409130_27795.jpeg" alt="58d9bec08dac7a74cc000015"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6</strong> (a) The inner and outer pressures on the spherical soap bubble are $P_i$ and $P_o$, respectively. (b) The forces pointing to the left are due to the surface tension. The forces<br>pointing perpendicular to the hemispherical surface are due to the air pressure inside the<br>bubble.</p>
<p>Figure 7b shows a free-body diagram for the right half of the bubble, on which two forces act. First, there is the force due to the surface tension in the film. This force is exerted on the right half of the bubble by the left half. The surface tension force points to the left and acts all along the circular edge of the hemispherical film. The magnitude of the force due to each surface of the film is the product of the surface tension $\gamma$ and the circumference ($2\pi R$) of the circular edge, or $\gamma(2πR)$. The total force due to the inner and outer surfaces is twice this amount or $−2\gamma(2\pi R)$. We have included the minus sign to denote that this force points to the left in the drawing. We have also assumed the film to be sufficiently thin enough that its inner and outer radii are nearly the same. Second, there is a force caused by the air pressure inside the bubble. At each point on the surface of the bubble, the force due to the air pressure is perpendicular to the surface and is directed outward. Figure 7b shows this force at six points on the surface. When these forces are added to obtain the total force due to the air pressure, all the components cancel, except those pointing to the right. The total force due to all the components pointing to the right is equal to the product of the pressure Pi inside the bubble times the circular cross-sectional area of the hemisphere, or $P_i (\pi R^2)$. Using these expressions for the forces due to the surface tension and air pressure, we can write Newton’s second law of motion as:</p>
<p>$$\sum F=0$$<br>$$-2\gamma (2\pi R) + P_i(\pi R^2)=0$$</p>
<p>Solving this equation for the pressure inside the bubble gives $P_i = 4\gamma /R$. In general, the pressure $P_o$ outside the bubble is not zero. However, this result still gives the difference between the inside and outside pressures, so that we have:</p>
<p>$$<br>P_i-P_o=\frac{4\gamma}{R}<br>\qquad\text{(Sephere soap bubble)}<br>\tag{2}<br>$$</p>
<p>This result tells us that the difference in pressure depends on the surface tension and the radius of the sphere. What is surprising is that a greater pressure exists inside a smaller soap bubble (smaller value of $R$) than inside a larger one.</p>
<p>A spherical drop of liquid, like a drop of water, has only one surface, rather than two surfaces, for there is no air within it. Thus, the force due to the surface tension is only one-half as large as that in a bubble. Consequently, the difference in pressure between the inside and outside of a liquid drop is one-half of that for a soap bubble:</p>
<p>$$<br>P_i-P_o=\frac{2\gamma}{R}<br>\qquad\text{(Sephere liquid drop)}<br>\tag{3}<br>$$</p>
<p>Equation 3 is known as Laplace’s law for a spherical liquid drop, after the French physicist and mathematician Marquis Pierre Simon deLaplace (1749–1827). This result also holds for a spherical bubble in a liquid, such as a gas bubble inside a glass of beer. However, the surface tension $\gamma$ is that of the surrounding liquid in which the trapped bubble resides. </p>
